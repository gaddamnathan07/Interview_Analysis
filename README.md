In the evolving landscape of recruitment, assessing candidatesâ€™ capabilities goes beyond technical 
knowledge and extends into evaluating soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, and 
emotional intelligence. Historically, these skills have been assessed through face-to-face interviews, 
which, while effective, have their limitations, including interviewer bias and inefficiency. A recent 
survey by Forbes (2021) indicated that 92% of hiring managers consider soft skills critical, but 33% of 
candidates fail to communicate their qualifications effectively due to poor preparation. In response to 
this gap, this research presents an AI-driven interview assessment system designed to enhance user 
performance through an interactive video-based process. The system integrates computer vision and 
speech recognition to capture and analyze video responses, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
to assess the quality of answers based on clarity, relevance, and depth. A model answer is generated 
via an LLM API, offering users a benchmark for improvement. The system provides real-time 
feedback, scoring answers on a scale from 1 to 10, with suggestions for improvement. Historical studies 
like those by McKinsey (2020) underline the importance of communication skills, and this system aims 
to address those deficiencies by delivering dynamic, personalized feedback and targeted 
recommendations, ultimately enhancing interview preparation and success
